# Research Projects

## Software Profiling of ALICE O2
Profiling the new software suite ALICE O2 developed by CERN for their run 3. Research involves executing sample workflows, profiling them with memory and CPU profiling tools to identifty potential bottlenecks.

## Accelerating k-mer Counting in a Commodity Cluster Environment

Research to explore the ability to utilize a commodity computer cluster to efficiently perform K-mer counting. Research is mainly based on searching for optimization strategies with MPI framework to obtain performance gains which can be scaled for a distributed environment.
