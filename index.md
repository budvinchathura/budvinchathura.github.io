# About

I am a graduate research assistant at <a href="https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Computer Science </a>, Tufts University. I am supervised by <a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/hari-sundar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Prof. Hari Sundar</a>. Before that I got my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://cse.mrt.ac.lk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Department of Computer Science & Engineering </a>,  University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

My primary research is in the intersection of scientific computations on distributed systems and graph decomposition. I am interested in utilizing graph algorithms to optimize computation and communication costs in scientific computations. I am also interested in building compilers for Domain Specific Languages for Partial Differential Equation solvers.

# Research

## Software Profiling of ALICE O2
Profiling the new software suite ALICE O2 developed by CERN for their run 3. Research involves executing sample workflows, profiling them with memory and CPU profiling tools to identify potential bottlenecks.

## Accelerating k-mer Counting in a Commodity Cluster Environment

Research to explore the ability to utilize a commodity computer cluster to efficiently perform K-mer counting. Research is mainly based on searching for optimization strategies with MPI framework to obtain performance gains which can be scaled for a distributed environment.
